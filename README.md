# STM32L432KC Embedded Systems Exploration

A collection of embedded systems experiments, drivers, and projects built using the STM32L432KC Nucleo development board.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning environment for exploring low-level embedded programming concepts, STM32 peripherals, hardware interfaces, and real-time system design.

## Goals

This project is focused on developing practical experience with:

* Bare-metal embedded programming
* STM32 peripheral configuration
* GPIO, timers, interrupts, and DMA
* UART, SPI, I2C, and other communication protocols
* Power management and low-power modes
* Sensor integration
* RTOS concepts and task scheduling
* Debugging and performance analysis

## Hardware

### Development Board

* STM32L432KC Nucleo-32
* ARM Cortex-M4 core
* 80 MHz maximum clock frequency
* Low-power STM32L4 series MCU

### Tools

* STM32CubeIDE
* STM32CubeMX
<!--
* ST-LINK debugger/programmer 
-->
<!--
* Logic analyzer (optional)
-->
<!-- 
* Oscilloscope (optional)
-->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* STM32CubeIDE installed
* ST-LINK drivers installed
* STM32L432KC Nucleo board connected via USB

### Build

Open the desired project in STM32CubeIDE and build using:

```bash
Project → Build Project
```

### Flash

Connect the board and use:

```bash
Run → Debug
```

or

```bash
Run → Run
```

to program the device through ST-LINK.

## Learning Notes

This repository is intentionally structured as a learning project. Code quality, architecture, and implementations may evolve as new concepts are explored and better approaches are discovered.

Key takeaways, references, and design decisions are documented throughout the repository.
